They can be caused by errors in data collection or measurement, or they can be legitimate observations that are simply rare. It is essential to handle outliers because they can have a significant impact on the results of statistical analyses, such as skewing the mean or causing incorrect correlations. Outliers can also lead to incorrect conclusions about the data, so it is important to identify and address them."

    "Answer: One method to balance the dataset and down-sample the majority class is to use a technique called undersampling. This involves randomly selecting a subset of the majority class and discarding the rest. Another technique is to use a technique called oversampling, which involves randomly generating additional data points from the minority class in order to balance the dataset. Finally, you can use a combination of both undersampling and oversampling to achieve an even distribution of classes."
